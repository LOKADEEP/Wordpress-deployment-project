 I have created and deployed a Wordpress website on AWS using AWS EC2. 
You can install Wordpress in a click by using AWS Lightsail, but I did it in the traditional way 
create a virtual computer on EC2, install and configure a web server,I used apache as the web server,database management system I used My Sql for it 
and finally install wordpress and connect a domain name to the created site.
